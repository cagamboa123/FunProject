# FunProject

Funproject uses the Rainbow HAT and the imx7D Android Things board. 

The project actually began as a test of the Rainbow HAT. 
The program turns on and off the LEDs, the seven segment displays, and the rainbow LEDs.
The program also looks for pushes on each button and publishes the temp reading to the seven segment. 

It is a good intro project for anyone interested in IoT.
